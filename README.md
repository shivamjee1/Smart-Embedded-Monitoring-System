# Smart Embedded Monitoring System

A structured embedded systems project developed step-by-step using Arduino.  
The project is simulated using Tinkercad and is designed to be deployed on real hardware.

## Objectives
- Learn embedded system development using Arduino
- Understand GPIO input and output
- Follow industry-style project structuring
- Use Git and GitHub for version control

## Project Phases
- Phase 1: LED and Push Button (GPIO validation) ✔
- Phase 2: Sensor Interfacing (ADC) ⏳
- Phase 3: Display Integration
- Phase 4: Threshold and Alert System
- Phase 5: Optional IoT Extension

## Tools and Technologies
- Arduino UNO
- Embedded C (Arduino framework)
- Tinkercad Circuits
- Git and GitHub

## Status
Phase 1 completed and verified using Tinkercad simulation.
